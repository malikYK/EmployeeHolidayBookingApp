# EmployeeHolidayBookingApp
## Project Goal And Definftion Of Done :clipboard:
This project is a system that allows employees of a company to book holidays and allows managers to approve or deny those requests.

This project aims to build a system with three layers: a GUI built in WPF, a SQL data backend and business layer that connected the two without knowing the other. The aimed learning outcomes were to learn about OOP, using WPF to insert data to a database, use the scrum methodology, and use git and GitHub effectively.

The project is done when all the code meets the functional requirements for the project idea, the business layer has been tested and passes them, the project is correctly pushed to git hub, and a practical user guide has been written.

## Sprint 1
### sprint goal :dart:
- Implent the base classes needed to create the database
### sprint review :white_check_mark:
- all classes where created database was impolmented corretly
- Migrating the database correclty(having the right data types and forign keys)  took longer than expected
### sprint retrospective
- The amount of work that I placed to complete in this sprint was a managable amount
- I worked at an normal pace
- I didnt push work to github as regularly as i should (but didnt run into any problems with this)

## Sprint 2
### sprint goal :dart:
- Implement the employee functionality/ user stories(adding and viewing holiday requests)
- start to test the business layer
### sprint review:white_check_mark:
- Most employee functionality/ user stories completed
- Added a few more user stories and completed them
- Moved on to completing some of the user stories for the manager side of the system 
### sprint retrospective
- This sprint went well alot functionality got completed 
- It took longer than expected so the test didnt get implemented


## Sprint 3
### sprint goal :dart:
complete All manager functionality and build tests for the business layer
### sprint review :white_check_mark:

### sprint retrospective

## overall RetroSpective
#### Throughout this project, I learnt a lot:
- The importance of encapsulation
- Testing
- how to the full stack system be cohesive but work independently
- The usefulness of scrum
- Time Management
- How to use a Kanban board
#### what I would do differently would be :
-  use git and git hub more effectively
- used an extension for WPF to give the GUI a different look
#### In the future, I plan to: 
- Develop the manager side of the system more
- add a login and user seesion function to the project
- Potentialy convert  the employee side to a web service or web application

## User guide
As an employee : 
- You will choose the employee side of the app

As a manager: 
- You will choose the managers page
