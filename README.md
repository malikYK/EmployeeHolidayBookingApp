# EmployeeHolidayBookingApp
## Project Goal And Definftion Of Done :clipboard:
This project is a system that allows employees of a company to book holidays and allows managers to approve or deny those requests.

This project aims to build a system with three layers: a GUI built in WPF, a SQL data backend and business layer that connected the two without knowing the other. The aimed learning outcomes were to learn about OOP, using WPF to insert data to a database, use the scrum methodology, and use git and GitHub effectively.

The project is done when all the code meets the functional requirements for the project idea, the business layer has been tested and passes them, the project is correctly pushed to git hub, and a practical user guide has been written.

## Sprint 1
### sprint goal :dart:
- Implent the base classes needed to create the database
### sprint review :white_check_mark:
